BABEL - Transpiling - Transpiled the ES6 Syntax that can be interpreted by wide range of browsers.
You can transpile JavaScript directly in the browser using the inline Babel transpiler.
You just include the browser.js file, and any scripts with type="text/babel" will be
converted.

asynchronous request, one of two things can happen: everything goes as we hope or
thereâ€™s an error.
