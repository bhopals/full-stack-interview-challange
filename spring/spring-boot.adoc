=== Spring Boot

Here are two of the most important benefits Spring Boot brings in:

Auto-configure applications based on the artifacts it finds on the classpath
Provide non-functional features common to applications in production, such as security or health checks.

-==== What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is basically an extension of the Spring framework which eliminated the boilerplate 
configurations required for setting up a Spring application.

It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform which paved the way for a faster and more 
efficient development eco-system.

Here are just a few of the features in Spring Boot:
- Opinionated ‘starter’ dependencies to simplify build and application configuration
- Embedded server to avoid complexity in application deployment
- Metrics, Helth check, and externalized configuration
- Automatic config for Spring functionality – whenever possible
