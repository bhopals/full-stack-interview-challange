=== Bubble Sort 

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping 
the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

*An example of Quadratic Algorithm

Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Boundary Cases: Bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

Sorting In Place: Yes

Stable: Yes

Due to its simplicity, bubble sort is often used to introduce the concept of a sorting algorithm.
The performance degrades as the size increases. For 10 Items, it takes 100 Steps to sort, for 100 items it takes 10000 steps to sort the array.

Its in-place algorithms as it does not require any extra memory space to sort the elements.


==== Practical Use of Bubble Sort
Its a type of sorting, best used when the data is small. i.e. the list of elements to be sorted is low.

==== Example  

    import java.util.HashSet;
    import java.util.Set;

    public class Main {

        // Driver program
        public static void main(String[] args) {

            int array[] = { 55, 3, 50, 23, 65, -12, -3, 5 };

            for (int unsortedArrayIndex = array.length - 1; unsortedArrayIndex > 0; unsortedArrayIndex--) {

                for (int i = 0; i < unsortedArrayIndex; i++) {

                    if (array[i] > array[i + 1]) {
                        swap(array, i , i+1);
                    }
                }
            }
            
            for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
                System.out.println(array[i]+" ");
            }
        }

        private static void swap(int array[], int currentIndex, int targetIndex) {
            
            if(currentIndex == targetIndex) {
                return;
            }
            
            int temp = array[currentIndex];
            array[currentIndex] = array[targetIndex];
            array[targetIndex] = temp;
                
        }

    }




=== REFERENCE

If we talk about Arrays.sort(int[] a) method in java Arrays (Java Platform SE 8 ), 
it doesnâ€™t use bubble sort at all. Depends on the array length, it uses merge sort, quick sort, insertion sort 
and count sort. From the source code there are different threshold defined for the sorting algorithm to 
be used. 
For example if array length is greater than 286 merge sort, 
less than 286 but greater than 47 quick sort, less than 47 insertion sort is used.
