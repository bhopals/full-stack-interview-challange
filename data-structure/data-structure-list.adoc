=== Array 
Array is a data structure used to store homogeneous elements at contiguous locations. Size of an array must be provided before storing data.


=== Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure (like arrays) where each element is a separate object. Each element (that is node) of a list is comprising of two items â€“ the data and a reference to the next node.
Types of Linked List : Singly Linked list, Doubly Linked List, and Circular Linked List 



=== Stack
A stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the last element that was added. In stack both the operations of push and pop takes place at the same end that is top of the stack. It can be implemented by using both array and linked list.


=== Queue
A queue or FIFO (first in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: enqueue, the process of adding an element to the collection.(The element is added from the rear side) and dequeue, the process of removing the first element that was added. (The element is removed from the front side). It can be implemented by using both array and linked list.


=== Binary Tree
Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures.
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. It is implemented mainly using Links
