=== JavaScript
JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative/procedural programming 
along with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and functional programming. 
JavaScript supports OOP with prototypal inheritance.



=== What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?

===== Class Inheritance
Instances inherit from classes (like a blueprint â€” a description of the class), 
and create sub-class relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies. Instances are typically instantiated 
via constructor functions with the `new` keyword. Class inheritance may or may not use the
 `class` keyword from ES6.

===== Prototypal inheritance
Instances inherit directly from other objects. Instances are typically instantiated via factory 
functions or `Object.create()`. Instances may be composed from many different objects, allowing 
for easy selective inheritance.
